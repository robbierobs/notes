# geography

## five themes of geography

1. **location**
  - refers to physical presence of a geographic place or feature on the surface of the Earth
  - *absolute location* and *relative location*
    - absolute location - latitude (parallels) and longitude (meridians) coordinates
      - latitudes (paralells) expressed as a distance north or south of the equator
        - line that divides the earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres is the **equator**
        - can go 90 degrees
          - 90 degrees north = North pole
          - 90 degrees south = South pole
      - longitude (meridians) expressed as a distance east and west of the prime meridian
        - range from 0 (prime meridian) to 180 degrees east or west (anti-meridian)
    - relative location - relationship between places
      - "the pet shop is between this and that"
2. **place**
  - wide range of human activities and human-environment interactions that occur in a particular location
  - where daily life occurs, build or economic and political systems, etc..
3. **human-environment interaction**
  - direct connections between humans and our biophysical world
    - when you drive your car the exhaust from your engine is emitted, carbon emissions feed air pollution that directly affects health, plant life etc.
    - buying a car is __not__ a direct human-environment interaction
      - while the car uses many natural resources in the environment, the act of purchasing the vehicle does not directly affect the environment around you
4. **movement**
  - concept that refers to the core idea that human beings and all animal life are always in motion
    - the world is never a static map of locations and places
    - geographers examine the patterns of how humans, animals and physical systems (rivers) move through geographic space
  - movement connects to bigger questions of economic and political power
5. **region**
  - examines the multiple ways that we divide and organize our world
  - examines the development and significance of formal regions, functional regions and vernacular/perceptual regions
    - formal regions
      - one with clearly defined boundaries
      - define what is both inside and outside the region
      - well-defined political boundaries
        - ex. District of Columbia - boundaries from Virginia and Maryland
        - ex. US EPA defines the US Corn Belt, Great Plains, and other ecological regions based on a series of measurable natural features
    - functional regions
      - web of places and territory bound together by a particular process or purpose
        - do not *necessarily* have cleared defined boundaries
        - defined by its purpose and by what purpose the region serves
          - ex.
            - retail establishment (car dealership)
            - Greater Los Angeles region - integrates communities, activities and physical environment
    - perceptual and vernacular regions
      - perceptual - regions in our mind
        - region from Buffalo, New York to Chicago, Illinois is commonly called "The Rust Belt" with the decline of industrial manufacturing in the past three decades.
          - cannot clearly define this Rust Belt on a map
      - generally understood cultural regions in which residents share similar lifestyles, heritage, or some shared identifying characteristics that may not be clear definable on a map with precise boundaries
        - most know of an Appalachian region or of the American South, yet these rarely will appear as clearly demarcated regions on a map

## chapter 1

**geography** is the study of interaction of all physical and human phenomena at individual places and of how interactions among places form patterns and organize larger spaces

* physical geography - studies the characteristics of the physical environment. when geography concentrates on topics such as climate, soil, and vegetation, it is a natural science
* human geography - studies human groups and their activities such as language, industry and the building of cities; it is a social science

geographic tools:
* cartography - map making
* remove sensing - mapping earth from satellites and aircraft
* geographic information systems (GIS) for storing, displaying and analyzing geographic data

**topical geography/systematic geography** is the study of climate, water, vegetation or minerals

most contemporary geographers employ three analytical methods
* area analysis: integrates the geographic features of an area or a place
* spatial analysis or locational analysis: emphasizes interactions among places
* geographic systems analysis: emphasizes the understanding of physical and human systems and the interaction among them

### area analysis
* site
  - the exact location of a place and be described either in terms of latitude and longitude or in terms of the characteristics of the place
* situation
  - location of a place relative to other places
  - knowledge of a place's situation helps us understand how it interacts with the rest of the world
  - **relative location** is location in reference to another place
  - expanding the scale of organization to cover the whole glove is **globalization**
* region
  - areas defined by one or more distinctive characteristics or features
    - climate
    - soil type
    - language
    - economic activity
  - common map that shows regions - map of the world
  - geographers study patterns of how people organize their societies and occupy land
  - **three different regions**
    - **formal region** is one that exhibits essential uniformity in one or more physical or cultural features
      - climate type
      - language area
    - **functional region**
      - defined by interactions among places
        - trade
        - communication
        - ex. Chicago
          - government covers the legal limits of the city's incorporations
    - **vernacular region**
      - means "everyday language"
      - widespread popular perception of their existence by people within or outside them
      - concept/abstract idea
      - "era" or "period"
      - art historians use "styles"
      - sociologist use "societies"
* spatial analysis
  - looks for patterns in the distribution of human actions, environmental processes and interactions among and between places or regions
* distribution
  - a phenomenon's position, placement or arrangement throughout space
  - use three terms to define distribution
    - density
      - frequency of occurrence in relation to geographic area
      - expressed as a number per square kilometer/mile
      - examples:
        - road density (number of kilometers of road per square kilometer)
        - population density (number of people per square kilometer)
    - concentration
      - distribution within a given area
        - if all occurrences are found in close proximity the distribution would be *concentrated*
        - if they are scattered far from each other they are *dispersed*
    - movement
      - distance
        - can be measured absolutely
          - time
          - terms of miles/kilometers
          - "as the crow flies"
        - cost distance
          - expense required to overcome the distance
          - land is more expensive than water, so 2 seaports that are far apart in absolute distance may be close in *cost distance*
          - explains why many political units grew up around the shores of bodies of water
        - friction of distance
          - effort to overcome distance when we want to move or transport items
          - limits interactions across great distances
      - distance decay
        - the impact of any phenomenon may diminish away from its origin
        - the further from a city, the less likely you are to go there for shopping or recreation
      - diffusion
        - an item or feature may spread across space through diffusion
        - tool, clothing fasion, development of technology
        - originates at a hearth
        - spreads like waves from a stone dropped in a pool of water
        - **relocation diffusion**
          - occurs when people or things move between points
          - migration to a new area
        - **contiguous or contagious diffusion**
          - occurs from one place to a neighboring place through direct contact
          - contagious disease shows how things can spread
          - culture and innovation can spread also
        - **hierarchical diffusion**
          - spread upward or downward in a hierarchy of organization
          - catholic church is an example
            - decisions move up and down through the church
            - decision to replace a parish priest might require approval by the archbishop or Vatican, etc.
          - topmost point in a hierarchy is the *apex*
          - small airports have to go to big airports, then back to a small airport
          - truck drivers drive from small towns to big towns then back to small towns
* model - idealized, simplified representation of reality that can be used as a standard to compare individual cases in the real world
* system - an interdependent group of items that interact in a regular way to form a unified whole
  - atmosphere (air)
    - thin layer of gases surrounding Earth
    - altitude less than 480 km/300 mi.
    - air is driven by solar radiation
    - redistribution of air vertically and horizontally is the main force creating weather and climate
  - hydrosphere (water)
    - water realm of Earth's surface
    - water can exist as vapor, liquid or solid
    - oceans, surface water, groundwater in soil/rock, water vapor in the atmosphere and ice in glaciers
  - lithosphere (Earth's solid rocks)
    - solid Earth
    - rocks and underlying sediments
  - biosphere (encompasses all of Earth's living organisms)
    - all living organisms on earth
    - environment which these organisms live is strongly influenced by
      - atmosphere
      - lithosphere
      - hydrosphere
      - organisms themselves

ecosystem - group of organisms and the nonliving physical and chemical environment with which they interact

the study of ecosystems is called ecology

culture is about everything about the way people live
  - what clothes they wear (if any)
  - how they gather or raise food
  - whether they recognizer marriage and if they do, whome (and how many spouses) they think is proper to marry
  - etc..

natural landscape - landscape with no evidence of human activity

cultural landscape - landscape that reveals the many ways people modify their local environment

**Earth is nearly spherical with a diameter of about 12,742 (8000 miles) and a circumference of about 40,000 kilometer (25,000 miles) highest point is almost 8,850 meters (29,000 ft) above sea level. It's lowest is about 10,920 meters (35,800 ft) below sea level. Equatorial diameter of Earth is slightly greater (43km, 27mi) than its polar diameter.**

  * passes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, just east of London
  * Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is prime meridian
  * time zones split by 15 degree per hour.
  * eastern is - 5 hours (75/15 = 5 west = -5)

maps are two-dimensional representation of some portion of Earth's surface

scale of a map is quantitative statement of the relative sizes of an object on a map and in reality

small-scale map - lot of land on a small page
large-scale map - small part of the Earth area on a large sheet of paper

remember 1/100 is *larger* than 1/1000

projection - transferal of locations on Earth's surface to locations on a flat map
* maps always are distorted due to being flat
* hundreds of projections but none is completely free of distortion

conformal maps are maps that distort size but preserver shape
* most common is the Mercator projection
* developed in 1569 for the purpose of navigation
* preserves shape and orientation
* most common used in online maps
* distorts as we approach the poles
  - greenland appears to be similar in size to south america, but in reality south america is nine times larger.
equal-area maps/equivalent projections are maps that preserver size but distort shape

Google Earth uses a azimuthal projection

CHAPTER REVIEW

Summary

What Is Geography?
* Geography is the study of the interaction of all physical and human phenomena at individual places, and spatial patterns of these phenomena and interactions. Physical geography studies the characteristics of the physical environment, while human geography studies human groups and their activities.
* Geography has deep roots in ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean region and eastern Asia, with Arab scholars making major contributions. Major advances occurred during European exploration in the 15th–18th centuries. A human–environment tradition emerged in the 1800s. Today, geography is one of the most diverse fields of academic study, bridging the social and natural sciences and the humanities.

Contemporary Geography

* Area analysis examines the characteristics of specific locations (sites) and their interactions with other places (situation). Area analysis also examines regions, including formal regions defined by uniformity of a particular physical or cultural feature, and functional regions defined by interactions among places. Spatial patterns are characterized by key attributes including distribution (position, placement or arrangement on Earth’s surface), density (frequency of occurrence in relation to geographic area), concentration (the degree to which features are found near to each other in certain places as opposed to broadly dispersed), and pattern (the geometric arrangement of objects within an area).


* Distance can be expressed in absolute terms, or in terms of travel time or cost. Distance affects the likelihood of interaction between places. Diffusion is the spread of a phenomenon from one place to another. Hierarchies of organization can affect information diffusion.


* Geographic systems analysis focuses on interactions between physical systems such as the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere.


* Geographers study human–environment interactions such as use of natural resources, and the role of culture in influencing such resource use.

Mapping Earth


* The latitude–longitude grid system helps determine location on the Earth’s surface. Latitude refers to angular distance north or south of the equator; longitude refers to angular distance east or west of Greenwich, England. Map scale, the ratio of size on a map to size on Earth’s surface, affects the amount of detail that can be shown on a map. Small-scale maps reduce the size of features and show less detail; large-scale maps make features larger and contain more detail. Creating a flat map of Earth’s curved surface via a set of rules called a projection requires distorting either shape or distance. Specialized thematic maps show particular features of Earth’s surface.

Geographic Information Technology

* Satellites enable rapid collection of large amounts of information that is stored, managed, analyzed, and displayed using geographic information systems. Raster-based information is stored by grid cells; vector-based information uses lines and points that are located by X–Y coordinates. Global positioning systems allow rapid determination of location and area used in millions of everyday devices. (Dahlman, 09/2013, p. 44)

# Step #2 Physical Geographic Systems

climate is comprised of weather over a period of years

weather includes variables such as temp, precipitation, etc

solar energy
* sun is a large themonuclear reactor
* solar energy heats atmosphere and surface
  - heats the air
  - creates pressure differences that generate wind and ocean currents
  - carry moisture from one part of the planet to another before the energy is dissipated into space

## insolation
amount of solar energy intercepted by a particular area of Earth
* depends on two factors
  - intensity of solar radiation, or the amount arriving per unit of time
    - depends on the angle at which the Sun's rays hit that place
    - angle of incidence
      - angle at which solar radiation strikes a particular place at any point in time
      - varies during a day and among seasons
  - the number of hours during the day that the solar radiation is striking
  - vernal (spring) equinox (March 20 or March 21)
  - autumnal equinox (September 22 or 23)
    - perpendicular rays of the Sun strike the equator
    - Sun is directly overhead at the equator
  - Tropic of Cancer (23.5N)
  - Tropic of Capricorn (23.5S)
    - radiation is reduced to 92% of the level of the equator
  - 45 n or s latitude is only at 71%
  - 60 n or  s latitude is only at 50%
* summer solstice (june 20 or 21) sun is directly above the Tropic of Cancer
*  from vernal equinox until the autumnal equinox (march until late september) the Sun is directly overhead at places along some latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere
* at the summer equinox, the Sun is again directly overhead at noon at the equator
* from september to march, places in the southern latitudes receive direct insolation
* sun is directly overhead places along Tropic of Capricorn (23.5 S) at noon on the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice

## Daylight hours

places on the equator always receive 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours of night
higher latitudes vary considerably with the seasons

variations in the length of daylight from place to place result from the 23.5 degree tilt of Earth's axis away from a perpendicular relation

during summer solstice, winnipeg gets 16 3/4 hours of daylight but only about 7 1/4 hours of daylight at the winter solstice

North pole is in full sunlight for 24 hours (called *Midnight Sun*)  during the summer solstice

## Spatial and seasonal variation in radiation inputs

the highest temperatures occur in low latitudes in both maps

high temperatures also occur in high latitudes such as in North America, Europe and Asia in July

the opposite effect is seen in winter
* high latitudes experience both low Sun angle and short days
* causes temperatures to be much lower
* season contrasts in temperature are greatest in high latitudes because incoming solar radiation is greatest there

## radiation
radiation is energy transmitted by electromagnetic waves, including radio, television, light and heat

wavelength is the distance between successive waves
* affects the behavior of the energy when it strikes matter
* some reflected
* some absorbed

shortwave energy
* most insolation
* .2 and 5 micron wavelengths (one-millionth of a meter is a micron)
longwave energy
* most energy reradiate by Earth is longwave, between 5 and 30 microns

shortwave energy from sun passes through atmosphere, reflects off the Earth and becomes longwave and is then absorbed by the atmosphere

blockage of outgoing longwave energy causes Earth's atmosphere to heat up

greenhouse effect - heating of the atmosphere

greenhouse gases - gases that are relatively transparent to shortwave but absorbing of longwave
* water vapor
* carbon dioxide (CO2)
* methane (CH4)

global warming is caused by increasing the amount of CO2 and methane from human activities

## latent heat exchange

sensible heat
* detachable by sense of touch
* heat you can feel (sun or hot pan)
* can measure it with a thermometer

latent heat
* "in storage* in water or water vapor"
* cannot feel latent heat
* when released has a powerful effect on immediate environment
* latent means "hidden"
* describes the heat that controls the state of water

latent heat exchange is what happens when water changes state

convection is the movement in any fluid caused when part of the fluid is heated
* center of water is heated, pushed out sides of heated area

advection is horizontal transfer of air

## mechanisms of precipitation
### condensation

conversion of water from vapor to liquid state

saturation vapor pressure - maximum water vapor  that air can hold
* precipitation begins when the saturation level is below the moisture content - **when moisture content is above the saturation level** -

relative humidity is the actual water content of the air, expressed as a percent of what the air could hold at a given temperature

### rising air

movement of air causes precipitation in three different ways:
1. convection - air warmer than surroundings rises, expands and cools
2. orographic uplift - wind forces air up and over mountains
3. frontal uplift - air is forced up a boundary(front) between cold and war air masses

adiabatic cooling is the decrease in temperature as a result from expansion of rising air

strong latent heat being released can be self-reinforcing, creating a strong vertical motion. can result in gusts of wind and heavy rain. A thunderstorm is a common example of convectional storms

**orographic precipitation** is when horizontal wind forces air to rise over mountain ranges

as it rises, it cools adiabatically, creating condensation (cooling) and creating precipitation

a dry region on the leeward side of a mountain range is called a *rain shadow*. as the air passes over the mountain and descends on the leeward side, the relative humidity drops significantly and temperature increases

examples of rain shadows - sierra and cascade mountains (eastern side) due to a moisture source not being present on the eastern side

rocky mountains (to a lesser extent)

### front precipitation

a front is a boundary between two air masses

an air mass is a large region of air, hundreds or thousands of square kilometers, with relatively uniform characteristics of temperature and humidity

continental polar air - air masses that form over Canada. Tend to be cool (high latitude) and dry (isolation from moisture sources)

maritime tropical air masses - warm humid air that forms over tropical water (such as Gulf of Mexico).

when a cool air mass (continental polar) meets a warm air mass (maritime tropical), a front or boundary may form between them. fronts are regions characterized by ascending air, cloudiness, windiness and precipitation

if a cold air mass advances against a warmer one, the boundary is called a **cold front**. as cold dense air advances, it goes underneath the warm air and forces it to rise, generating clouds,  usually resulting in precipitation. cold fronts can move quite fast and generate intense thunderstorms if the warm air is sufficiently moist

a warm front is when a warm air mass advances on a cold front. the warm air will gently ride up the cold front. less precipitation will occur. freezing rain is common as warm air drops its moisture and the moisture falls through the cold air below

## circulation patterns

atmospheric pressure

the higher you go, the less air exists above you

atmospheric pressure is greater at sea level than in "mile-high" Denver.

barometer measures atmospheric pressure. pressure is measured based on sea-level

average pressure at sea level is 1013.2 millibars

## coriolis effect

the deflection of wind or any other object moving on Earth's rotating surface is called the Coriolis effect

high and low pressure circulation systems turn in opposite directions in the northern and southern hemispheres

deflection to the right in the northern hemisphere
deflection to the left in the southern hemisphere

if a plane flew from the north pole in a straight line, it would land to the west (from Earth's rotation).

high pressure spin in clockwise in northern hemisphere
high pressure spin in counter-clockwise in southern hemisphere

## global atmospheric circulation

### intertropical convergence zone

dependable year-round inputs of solar energy heat the air, causing low pressure and convectional lifting. afternoon thunderstorms are common. between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn where winds converge

### trade winds

air moving towards the ITCZ is deflected by the Coriolis effect to form the Northeast Trade Winds in the northern hemisphere and Southeast Trade Winds in the southern hemisphere. trade winds are called that because they were so important to sailing ships that were involved in commerce.

### subtropical high-pressure zones

dry air, bright sunshine and little precipitation. air that spreads poleward from the ITCZ descends at about 30 deg. north and south latitudes in zones of high pressure that are especially strong over the oceans. creates arid climate because uplift is needed for condensation, cloud formation, and precipitation. most major desert regions are on land in this zone

# climate

climate is the summary of weather conditions over 30 years or more, a pattern of a place's weather

climate changes over time, some by humans

## precipitation

### water availability

transpiration is the process that a plant take water through its root and evaporates it through its leaves

potential evapotranspiration (POTET) is the amount of water a plant could take if their moisture were available and amount that could be evaporated

## classifying climate

### tropical - warm all year
#### humid tropical - tropical, constantly warm and humid
#### seasonally humid tropical -tropical, constantly warm and humid, pronounced dry low-sun season and wet high-sun season
### dry climates
#### desert- hot/cool desert climate
#### semiarid - hot/cold semiarid (steppe) climate
### midlatitude with warm summers and cool winters
#### humid subtropical - humid, warm subtropical climate, hot summers
#### marine west coast - warm/cool summers, no dry season
#### mediterranean - dry warm summers, cool wet winters
### midlatitude climates - warm summers and cold winters
#### humid continental - hot/warm summers, cold winters
#### subarctic cool- summers, very cold/frigid winters
### polar climates
#### tundra very cool short summers, frigid winters
#### icecap and ice sheets - temps consistently below freezing

## Earth's climate regions

### humid low-latitude tropical climates
#### humid tropical climates

lie within 10 degree north and south of the equator, can extend to 20 N or 20 S

include world's tropical rainforests

warm throughout the year

variation in temperature is greater in a single day vs coolest month to warmest month

high moisture due to temperature, high POTET, very humid, great plant growth, heavy rainfall (convectional)

#### seasonally humid tropical climates

half the rainfall as humid tropical, (48in vs 96 inch)

extended dry periods (wet for May to October, dry for the following 6 months). Plant growth is strongly seasonal

monsoonal rains are crucial to agriculture in Asia

#### dry climates - desert climates

over 35% of Earth's land but fewer than 15% of the world's inhabitants

typically located immediately north or south of low latitude humid climates

 some areas - cool ocean air cools the the lower layers of the atmosphere and reduces evaporation, convection and precipitation

high temp, low rainfall (cairo, egypt) (40 C (104F) annual potet = 150, precipitation, < 20)

#### semiarid climates

lie in transitional area between deserts and humid climates

precipitation is 20-50

steppes - worlds grasslands- are typically in this climate type, supports grazing activities but only limited agriculture

caused by rain shadow effect

long summer days, bright sunshine

cool part of the year

#### warm midlatitude climates

seasonal variation in insolation profoundly influence temperature

summer - more radiation per day that equatorial areas

winter - insolation cut in half or even a third of summer levels which brings a distinct cool season

rainy spells separated by dry spells, rainfall any time of the day

#### humid subtropical climates

latitudes between 25 and 40 degrees on the eastern sides of the continents

latitudes between 35 and 50 on the western side

relatively warm most of the year but have at least occasional freezing temperature during the winter

southeastern US, eastern china, parts of Brazil and Argentina

precipitation may occur all year or be concentrated in summer, which may bring monsoonal effect.

cool winter temps bring occasional frost, snowfall occurs poleward, but ground is not frozen or snow covered for long

long growing seasons

#### marine west coast climates

continental west coasts between 35 and 65 degrees

western North America between California and coastal Alaska, southern Chile, northwestern Europe, southeastern Australia and New Zealand

moderated by ocean temps

summer temps are 60F to 77F, winters are 23F-59F even when snow falls

high rainfall

#### mediterranean climates

western margins of continents

dry summer mediterranean climate envelops the Mediterranean region of Europe and parts of northern Africa, southwestern Australia, California and central coastal Chile.

arid summer, more frequent storms in the winter

significant water availability problems. Rome may not see any rain from May to October. Precipitation occurs in winter, when human, animal and vegetative demand for water is low.

#### cold midlatitude climates

strong seasonal contrasts with temperature more than moisture availability

35 to 60 degree latitude in interior and eastern portions of Northern Hemisphere continents.

Almost exclusive to the North Hemisphere because very little landmass exists in the Southern Hemisphere at these latitudes

summer temps are warm from long days and high solar angles, more radiation than tropical locations.

winter days are short and Sun is low in the sky, temps fall below freezing

rainfall between 24-60 inches, annual evapotranspiration 20-35 inches

#### subarctic climates

agriculture is generally not possible due to winter temperatures being cold enough and growing season short enough

no abrupt temperature or precipitation boundary, difference literally is one of degrees

conifers dominate

limited to the northern hemisphere also

extremely cold winters (-4 to +14F) and months of sub-freezing weather. temps rise rapidly in spring, 15-20 hour summer days bring mild temps

growing seasons is short (June to September)

cool summer (50-68F) but frosts continue as late as June, first frost is typically in September

annual rainfall is low (8-20 inches). summer water shortages are rare even though evapotranspiration may exceed precipitation during part of the summer

#### polar climates

low average temperatures and extremely seasons variability

at and around the poles, differentiated by temperature alone

scant insolation, zero during winter at the poles to highest daily totals on Earth for a brief peiod at midsummer

#### tundra climates

temps low all year, rising above freezing only for a brief cool summer

annual average temperature is below freezing

winters below -4F, highs rarely exceed 50-59F even though the Sun can shine 20-24 hours a day

soil 5-6.5 feet below the surface is insulated from seasonal temperature changes and stay close to the annual average.

permafrost is the condition of a permanently frozen ground

precipitation rarely exceeds 12 inches for the year, most fall as snow

water is plentiful because evapotranspiration rate is low

most of the year water is present as ice rather than liquid

at the northern limit, the boreal forest gives way to a treeless landscape in which vegetation survives the long winter by staying close to the ground

low-lying hardy vegetation is called *tundra* which gives the climate its name

#### ice cap climates

all of Antarctica and most of the Arctic

permafrost is extensive and thick under a year-round cover of snow or ice

extremely low temps prevent air from holding much water, annual precipitation is less than 4 inches, falling as snow and compacting into a thick mass of glacial ice that flows to sea rather than melting in place

some places it is desert like, free of snow or ice cover

## Chapter 2 Summary

Energy and Weather
•Weather is the temperature, precipitation, and so on at any particular time; climate is the statistical summary of weather over time, and includes both the average conditions and the extremes.

•Solar radiation heats Earth, varying by latitude, season, and by day length. The annual total radiation is highest and varies least over the seasons in low latitudes, while day length and angle of incidence cause greater seasonal variations at high latitudes. Energy arrives from the Sun as shortwave energy and is reradiated by Earth as longwave radiation that heats the atmosphere. Insolation and subsequent energy exchanges control temperatures and drive atmospheric circulation, causing storms and precipitation.

•Four main processes transfer energy between the atmosphere and Earth’s surface: (1) Longwave radiation sends heat from the warm surface to the cooler atmosphere. This radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere mainly by water vapor and carbon dioxide, and reradiated both downward to the surface and upward to space; (2) conduction of heat into soil, rock, and water store heat temporarily near Earth’s surface; (3) convection carries surface warmth to the atmosphere; and (4) when clouds and precipitation form, latent heat exchange carries energy from the surface to the atmosphere.

Precipitation

•Convection causes air to cool, leading to cloud formation and precipitation. This releases latent heat into the atmosphere, further stimulating convective circulation. This circulation can be localized, or can become organized into large-scale storm systems such as tropical and midlatitude cyclones.

•Fronts are boundaries between air masses of different densities. Cold air is typically more dense than warm air. When cold air advances toward warm air, a cold front is formed. The cold air drives under the less dense warm air, driving it up, and often causing precipitation. When warm air advances toward cold air, a warm front is formed, and the warm air rises over the cold, sometimes causing precipitation.

Circulation Patterns

•Global circulation patterns include bands of low pressure and convective lifting in the tropics, high pressure and descending air in the subtropics, low pressure in the midlatitudes, and high pressure at the poles. Surface winds blow from high pressure toward low pressure, deflected by Coriolis force. Thus, in low latitudes winds blow from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere, toward the equator. In the midlatitudes, winds generally blow from the west, and in the polar regions winds tend to be easterly but variable in the north polar region.

•Ocean surface circulation generally follows the prevailing winds, creating large gyres that are clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. In the midlatitudes of the southern hemisphere, strong currents blow around the globe from west to east. Vertical circulation is controlled by differences in water density.

Climate

•Climate classification provides a tool for describing climate and communicating that description. The most important variables in defining climate are temperature and precipitation. The most widely used classification scheme classifies climate into five main categories. Humid tropical (A) climates occur in the tropical low-pressure zone and are dominated by the intertropical convergence. Dry climates (B) are found generally on the western sides of continents in the subtropics and in continental areas isolated from moisture sources. Warm midlatitude climates (C) occur in subtropical areas on the eastern sides of continents and on west coasts at higher latitudes. Cool midlatitude climates (D) occur in continental areas, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. Polar climates (E) occur at high latitudes.

Climate Change

•Climate changes result from changes in the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the Sun; geologic factors such as volcanic eruptions; and changes in the composition of the atmosphere, some human caused. Human-induced global warming, caused primarily by burning fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, is under way, demonstrating the key role humans play in Earth’s physical processes.

## hydrologic cycle

flow
* evaporation converts liquid water in lake/oceans into vapor
* water falls to ground and ocean through condensation and precipitation
* runoff carries water from the land to the sea

water facts

97.3% of water is in oceans
2% is store in glacial ice
0.6% is available as freshwater (groundwater being the major storage)
0.008% is in rivers and lakes
0.001% is in the atmosphere

## water budgets

an accounting of all the inflows and outflows of water in a given system over a specified time

essential for water resource managers -> they determine the water available for human use

basic water budget equation is: precipitation - evaporation = runoff

### Evapotranspiration and local water budgets

in well-vegetated areas, much of the conversion takes place in the leaves of plants

evapotranspiration (ET) - evaporation + transpiration
transpiration is the process where plants take water from the soil through their roots

evapotranspiration takes energy. most productive in warm temperatures, virtually stops at freezing

evapotranspiration is best on dry windy days vs humid calm days

**potential evapotranspiration (POTET)** is the amount of water that would be evaporated if it were available

**actual evapotranspiration (ACTET)** is the amount that actually is evaporated under existing conditions

### role of soil in the water budget

soil stores water and makes it available for evapotranspiration

infiltration capacity determines if rain will infiltrate soil or run off

lay of organic litter covering soil, worms and insects keeping soil porous, dense vegetation means good infiltration

compacted or bare soil has greater runoff vs infiltration

## vegetation and the hydrologic cycle

forests occur where ample moisture is available for most of the year

a single tree can transpire 1,000 liters per day in warm weather

deciduous trees transpire less water than coniferous (evergreen)

grasses thrive in wet upper soil but transpiration virtually ceases when the upper soil is dry, allowing it to survive dry seasons

### deforestation

since about 1970, deforestation in the Amazon Basin has average about 7,000 square miles per year, about 0.4% of the basin's area per year

by 2011, about 288,000 miles had been deforested, about the size of Texas

the rate of deforestation reached a peak in 1995 but has been slowly declining since the early 2000s

## soil

interface between lithosphere and biosphere/atmosphere is soil

uppermost part of the lithosphere, key portion of the biosphere

soil property five major factors
1. climate regulates both water movement and biological activity
2. parent material is the mineral matter from which soil is formed
3. biological activity - plants and animals- moves minerals and adds organic matter to the soil
4. topography affects water movement and erosion rates
5. all factors work over time, requiring thousands of years to create a mature soil

### soil formation

weathering creates soil
* mechanical weather (ice expansion, tree roots growing in cracks of rocks)
* chemical weather (dissolving limestone in water in the soil)

water budget indicates how much water moves through the soil in a place and measure the significance of water in local weathering
* annual precipitation 100cm, evapotranspiration is 70cm, 30 cm of water would seep down through the soil on an average year
* 30cm of water would be a powerful weathering agent
* if precipitation is 70 and evapotranspiration is 150, no water would  percolate through the soil to help weather the rocks

plant, animal and topography play a critical role in the weather process also

### soil horizons

soil contains six principal components
1. rock and rock particles - greatest portion of soil, may weather and release nutrients needed for plants
2. organic matter - composed of dead and decaying plant and animal remains that holds water, supports soil organisms, supplies nutrients
3. dissolved substances - phosphorus, potassium, calcium and other nutrients for plants
4. organisms - insects, worms, microorganisms, bacteria and fungi
5. water from rainfall - necessary for plant growth and substance distribution
6. air - share pore spaces with water, respiration by plant roots and soil organisms

formed from vertical movement of water, minerals, and organic matter in the soil

*O* horizon (organic) - at surface
*A* horizon - contains much of the nutrients that support plant life
*B* horizon - organisms help move minerals from A to B. Clay minerals formed from chemical weathering often accumulate in the B horizon. In dry climates, calcium accumulates here
*C* horizon - contains the parents material of the stuff above it. This material hasn't been altered as completely yet in this horizon

### thousands of soils

soils are divided into:
* 11 broad clusters (**soil orders**)
* 47 sub-orders
* 230 great groups
* 1200 subgroups
* 6000 families
* thousands of soil series

*high-latitude* areas - cool temps + wet conditions, low evapotranspiration rates, reduced decomposition of plant matter, histosols
*humid tropical* and *subtropical soils* - oxisols and ultisols are highly weathered. lost soluable minerals due to to heavy precipitation, may deplete soil of nutrients. red in color
*midlatitudde humid soils* - alfisols and spodosols. moderately leached where dominated by deciduous forest vegetation, heavily leached where dominated by coniferous forests
*arid region soils* - aridisols - high in soluable minerals becuase little leaching occurs. Low in organic matter, very productive if sufficiently irrigated.
*midlatitude subhumid soils* - mollisols - fetible and are resource base for many important grain-producing regions.

### soil quality

a term used to describe how well soil can be used for:
* storing carbon or nutrients
* removing pollutants from water
* providing medium for diverse insects and microbial communities

#### human impacts on soil quality

desertification is a process caused by humans that makes semiarid vegetation and soils more desertlike

#### improving soil quality

old method was to use fertilizer from animal manure

new methods include increasing organic matter

## ecosystem

includes all living organisms in an area and the physical environment which they interact

fundamental elements:
* producers - green plants and other organisms that produce food for themselves and consumer that eat them
* consumers - organisms that eat producers, other consumers or both
* decomposers - small organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, insects and worms that digest and recycle dead organisms
* abiotic materials and energy necessary for production and consumption to occur - water, mineral nutrients, gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and energy (light and heat).

### ecosystem processes

food distributed through the **food chain**

tertiary consumers
secondary consumers
primary consumers
producers

each step in food chain is called **trophic level**

about 10% of energy consumed as food at a given trophic level is converted to a new biomass, remaining 90% is burned off and dissipated as heat. this explains why there are more herbivores than carnivores, there is less energy to support them

bio-magnification is the process that explains how DDT and other pesticides increase concentration in the trophic levels (plants has pesticides, 10 lbs eating by 5 mice, hawk eats the mice, indirectly has eaten 50lbs of plants and the pesticides that have)

pesticides builds in animal tissue but is not excreted


## chapter summary

Biogeochemical Cycles

•The hydrologic cycle moves water among the oceans, land, and atmosphere via evaporation, evapotranspiration, and precipitation. Knowledge of the water budget is essential to understanding both physical and biological processes because the water budget is a critical regulator of ecosystem activity. This influence extends to human use of the landscape, through such issues as determining the natural vegetation cover or agricultural potential.

Carbon, Oxygen, and Nutrient Flows in the Biosphere

•Carbon is the basis of life on Earth. It cycles through the atmosphere, oceans, biosphere, and soil. Photosynthesis transfers carbon from the atmosphere to the biosphere, and respiration returns it to the atmosphere.
•Plant growth is most prolific in warm, humid climates where water and energy are plentiful. Plant growth is less in dry or cool climates.
•Large amounts of carbon are exchanged between the atmosphere and the oceans, and the oceans are major sinks for carbon dioxide that is added to the atmosphere by fossil fuel combustion.

Soil

•The outermost layer of Earth’s surface in land areas is soil, which is a mixture of mineral and organic matter formed by physical, chemical, and biological processes.
•Climate is a major regulator of soil development, through its control on water movement. Plant and animal activity in the soil produces organic matter and mixes the upper soil layers. In humid regions, water moves downward through the soil, carrying dissolved substances lower in the profile or removing them altogether. In arid regions, these substances are not so easily removed. Soil characteristics reflect these processes, and there is close correspondence between the world climate map and the world soil map.

Ecosystems

•Ecosystems consist of living organisms and the physical environments with which they interact. Photosynthesis is the basis of food chains and ecological systems. Plants compete for water, sunlight, and nutrients, and plants that are best adapted to compete for limiting factors will dominate a given environment. Such adaptations help explain the world distribution of major vegetation types.
•Very large portions of the world’s land surface have been modified by human activity, and humans are major players in most of the world’s ecosystems.

Biomes: Global Patterns in the Biosphere

•The world vegetation map closely mirrors the world climate map. Ecologically diverse and complex forests occupy humid environments, storing most nutrients in their biomass. In arid and semiarid regions, sparse vegetation is adapted to moisture stress. Forests adapted to winter cold are in humid midlatitude climates, developing as broadleaf forests in warmer areas and coniferous forests in subarctic latitudes. In high-latitude climates, cold-tolerant short vegetation occupies areas that have a mild summer season. Vegetation is absent in ice-bound polar climates.
•Overall, climate is the strongest control on natural vegetation, but humans have had profound influences on ecosystems in most of the world’s land areas. Only a few thousand years ago, Earth was regulated by nonhuman processes, and people were merely negligible players. Today, however, humans are globally significant and locally dominant players in Earth’s biogeochemical cycles. Environments in which human impacts are minor are increasingly scarce.

## resources

natural resources
anything created through natural processes that people use and value
* plants
* animals
* coal
* water
* air
* land
* metals
* sunlight
* wilderness

natural resource is defined by three elements of society
1. cultural values - desirable and acceptable to use
2. technology must be high enough to use the resource
3. economic system affects whether a resource is affordable and accessible

potential resources
things that might become resources in the near future

supply and demand

externalites are spill-over effects arising from production and/or consumption of goods and services for which appropriate compensation is not paid (people receiving pollution from electric plant, they get it whether they like it or not)



**acid deposition** acid rain

**eutrophication** fertilizer nourishing excessive production of phytoplankton

**toxic substances** chemicals that are harmful even in very low concentrations

## Chapter 5 Review

Summary

What Is a Natural Resource?

•Cultural values determine how resources are used. Technological factors limit our use of some resources by determining the particular applications to which certain materials can be put. Economic factors such as resource prices and levels of affluence influence whether a resource is used, and how much
.•Most resources are substitutable to some degree, so that if one resource is less available or more expensive another resource is available to take its place. Price and usefulness of a resource in a given technological setting determine choice of one resource over another.
•Nonrenewable resources form so slowly that for practical purposes, they cannot be replaced when used. Nonrenewable resources include fossil fuels and nonenergy minerals. Renewable resources are replaced continually, at least within a human lifespan. Renewable natural resources include air, water, soil, plants, and animals.

Geological and Energy Resources

•Use of mineral resources changes as technology and economics change. New technologies can simultaneously increase demand for one mineral and decrease that for another. Variations in price, which can be caused by variations in supply of a resource, can also influence demand. For most mineral resources, most of global supply is produced by a relatively small number of countries.
•Growing worldwide demand has caused increases in energy prices, although prices have sometimes fallen dramatically during economic recessions. Generally, high prices have stimulated exploration for new deposits and development of technologies for extracting more gas and oil from existing fields. This has caused available resources to expand along with global demand.
•Renewable hydroelectric power is a major source of energy, and may expand significantly in South America and Asia. Wind energy produces a small but rapidly growing amount of energy. Solar power offers considerable potential for future electric generation.

Air and Water Resources

•Acid deposition results from emissions of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. Coal-fired power plants are major sources of these pollutants, as are gas-fired electric plants and automobiles. The worst problems with acid deposition are in east Asia, central Europe, and the northeastern United States, all of which are areas of substantial use of coal to generate electricity.
•The greatest problems in urban air pollution derive from carbon monoxide, and from photochemical smog. Photochemical smog is produced by the effect of sunlight acting on nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons. In the past, emissions from coal and other crude fuels were most important in urban air pollution; these are still significant in some poorer countries.
•Discharges of organic matter and fertilizers to streams cause eutrophication—excessive growth of algae—which depletes dissolved oxygen when the algae die and decay.

Forests

•The development of plywood in the early 20th century, and other forms of manufactured wood since then, have made it possible to make large, strong boards out of smaller pieces. This has reduced the need for large, old trees, and facilitated the use of small, young trees.
•Among the important uses of forests are timber products such as lumber and paper, recreation, biodiversity preservation, and carbon storage. These different uses may conflict with each other. Common ownership of many forest areas sometimes increases conflict.

## summary

In this chapter, our concern is to apply the geographer’s approach to understanding what development involves within a world region framework; to understand the revolutionary kinds of change that reshape societies and economies, with special emphasis on globalization; and to identify the growing need to guide change so it is sustainable and beneficial.

Globalization plays an increasingly significant role in the development process, although the blending, culturally transforming effects of globalization should not be overstated. We also examined how long-term development requires a commitment by people to understand the environments of which they are a part, and to act creatively in directing the impulses that determine whether human habitats will be carelessly degraded in the interest of short-term gain or planned in favor of long-term benefit. The combination of landforms, climate, vegetation, soils, and resource endowments create positive places that favor development. Humans tend to concentrate in these places, and over time these places reflect millennia of cultural diffusion and inheritance from initial culture hearths. They also reflect a continuing accumulation of technological innovations and cultural practices that shape the development settings of countries and regions.

Sustainable development promotes change that leads to improved well-being in people’s lives, takes into account the needs of future generations, is based on principles of stewardship, and is compatible with local cultural and environmental contexts. Sustainable use of the planet in support of peoples’ lives—environmental stewardship—requires knowledge of the physical and cultural setting of development.

Per capita income, agricultural employment, energy use, and other measures are potential indicators of development, but each measure has drawbacks. Although a number of theories exist to explain the development process, each is limited in its explanatory power and none is a complete explanation of development.

## Summary

The Distribution and Density of Human Settlement

•The population of Earth is about 7.2 billion people, and 90% of the population is concentrated on less than 20% of the land area. Major population concentrations are in east Asia, south Asia, and Europe. Secondary concentrations are in Southeast Asia and eastern North America. Much of Earth’s land surface is virtually uninhabited.

•Factors that explain population distribution include the historical importance of places with climactic and topographic conditions that could support agriculture. Most of the population is concentrated in areas of mild midlatitude or seasonal humid tropical climates, but people can settle in harsh areas, especially with adaptive technologies. In some places, local population densities may be high, but trade and circulation free members of societies from the constraints of their local environments.

World Population Dynamics

•The world population is increasing, but the rate of growth is slowing. The rate of increase in each country represents a balance among the crude birth rate, the crude death rate, and migration. Concern over population size focuses on the total fertility rate (TFR), which has been dropping in most countries. Most of the population increase is occurring in poor, not rich, countries.

•Countries generally transition through four stages of demographic change. The demographic transition describes changes occurring in a society that begins with high birth rates and high death rates but stable population size. Declining death rates cause populations to grow, slowing only once birth rates start to decline later on. Population sizes stabilize as birth rates and death rates reach historic lows. Many rich countries’ populations are now experiencing birth rates that are lower than death rates, causing population size to shrink and signaling a new phase of population decline.

•In today’s poor countries, crude birth rates are dropping fast but for different reasons, it seems, than wealthier countries. Theories of explanation focus on the growing role of family-planning programs, the status of women, new contraceptive technologies, and changing attitudes about fertility. Family-planning efforts face obstacles in traditional cultures, religions, and—in some cases—the cost of devices.

Other Significant Demographic Patterns

•The natural ratio between females and males in a human population should be one to one, but, worldwide, men outnumber women. However, the sex ratio varies greatly among different countries. This may be due to a combination of economic and cultural factors.

•The median age of humankind as a whole is rising. In rich countries, questions arise about the possibility of sustaining economic growth and about the equitable distribution of wealth among different generations. Many poor countries must quickly build up their national incomes and devise national welfare or social security programs.

Migration

•Human migrations have redistributed populations throughout history, and significant migrations continue. Push factors drive people away from wherever they are, and pull factors attract them to new destinations, but some migrations have been forced. Migration may be voluntary or involuntary, and cross long or short distances. Some migration is temporary.

•Internal migration is usually characterized by pull factors like moving to find work or live near family.

•Most international labor migration is between neighboring countries. High unemployment and low pay often pushes skilled workers out of poorer countries, pulled toward wealthier countries with active economies.

•Forced migration is typified by push factors such as force or the threat of violence. Pull factors are less important but can include humanitarian policies or cultural affinities in other neighboring countries.

•Amenity migration is driven mostly by pull factors such as affordability, natural or cultural features, and comfortable or luxury lifestyles.

Migration in Context

•Migration has changed the character and composition of many populations through history and in the current era. Three areas that are undergoing significant changes due to migration include Europe, Asia, and North America.

•After centuries of European emigration, natural decrease in recent decades means that immigrants play an important role in sustaining economic vitality. Rising proportions of immigrants, especially from outside Europe, have been met with intolerance in many countries.

•Asian countries have sent many emigrants abroad, especially to the Americas. Chinese emigrant communities have disproportionately more wealth in some Asian countries.

•North America has been shaped by the marginalization of its native populations and the huge influx of immigrants beginning with Europeans and Africans. Asian and Latino immigration continue to shape the population of the United States. Anti-immigrant attitudes and policies largely target growing Latino population, even those who are long-time U.S. citizens.
