Make a schedule - stick to it

If we all got our act together colelctively and stop making things worse, because that's another thing people do all the time, not only do they not do what they should to make things better, they actively attempt to make things worse because their spiteful or resentful or arrogant or decietful or homicide or genecidal or all of those t hings all bundled together in an absolutely pathological package. if people stopped really really trying just to make things worse, we have no idea how much better they would get just because of that.
