**Module 5 - Goals of a presentation**

* Your attitude plays a role in effective public speaking
* Your understanding of ethos pathos and logos will affect your succes as a speaker
* Great presentations are often communicated in much the same way that you tell a good story

* Which is NOT an assumption of the contemporary approach to public speaking?
* **Answer:** You must use multimedia elements in your speech

* Start with a good attitude
*	**Believe that you have something important and worthwhile to share.**
*	**Know that public speaking makes you vulnerable but that fedback and criticism can be very useful.**
*	**Understand that the best public speaking style is a conversational one.**
*	**Create and maintain a genuine positive regard for your audience.**
*	**Believe and reassure yourself that you will succeed**

* Ethos, Pathos, and Logos
* 	**Ethos**
* 		Ethos refers to characteristics of the speaker. Influence through speech is achieved when listeners believe that the speaker is credible.
*		Ethos refers to a speaker's trustworthiness.
*		Ethos refers to the audience's perception of the speaker's level of concern for their best interests.
*	**Pathos**
*		Pathos refers to the ability to arouse emotion within the audience
*		Can highlight characteristics of his or her subject and use appeals designed to provok the emotion he or she feels is most appropriate for generating the desired decision or action from the audience.
*		**Audience emotions that may be useful**
*			Anger
*			Fear
*			Grief
*			Guilt
*			Happiness
*			Pity
*			Spite
*	**Logos**
*		Logos refers to discourse that is supported by logical reasoning.
*		Importance of demonstrating
* Logic and Critical Thinking
* 	**Two types of logos**
* 		**Inductive**
*			Specific instances or examples and reasons to a universal or another specific instance
*			Specific instance, universal claim.
* 		**Deductive**
* 			Begins with general claims and moves to a specific instance. Syllogism
* 				All men are mortal. - Major Premise
*				Socrates is a man. - Minor Premise
*				Thereforce, Socrates is mortal. - Conclusion
*	**Logical Fallacies**
*		**Hasty generalizations**
*			Inductive reasoning can come to a general conclusion based on too few or unrepresentative examples
*		**Straw Peson**
*			When refuting an argument that has been made, it's far easier to defeat a weaker form of the argument than it is to engage weith the real reasoning present in the argument.
*		**Post hoc ergo propter hoc**
*			Lating for "after, therefore because of". One event that precedes a second event is assumed to have caused the second event. 
*			Ex. Superstition
*		**Forced dichotomy**
*			Speaker presents only two solutions to a problem, ignoring other solutions either purposefully or out of ignorance. 
*			Ex. "We cut funding for education or the city goes bankrupt." Ignoring raising taxes, etc.
*		**Ad hominem**
*			Latin for "about the person".
*			Someone refutes an argument by attacking the person who presented the argument rather than the argument itself.
*		**Appeal to misplaced authority**
*			Reputation of an expert in an unrelated field.
*			Ex. Advertisements featuring celebrity endorsements when the spokesperson's expertise has nothing to do with the product.
*		**Examples**
*		1. Becuase the management ream implemented a plan to cut costs before the company experienced an increase in profits, the implementatino of the plan caused the increase in profits. - Post hoc ergo propter hoc
*		2. "If you want to succeed as an actor, you will need to move to Los Angeles" - Forced dichotomy
*		3. "I do not take this philospher's work seriously...struggled with depression, etc..." - Ad hominem
*		4. "I don't care what the manual says, my mechanic says this type of fuel is no different...." - Appeal to misplaced authority
*	**A Good Presentation is a Lot Like a Good Story**
*		Good stories have:
*			A topic of interests/significance
*			A storyline/plot that takes place over a time period, reflecting that most human situations are complex/detailed.
*			Elements that makes the story concrete,vivid, memorable via language or the way it's told.
*			Appropriate setting - vivid detail
*			Beginning, middle, end
*			Conflict/dilemma that climaxes then is usually resolved realistically.
*		Good stories share:
*			They are realistic
*			The are organized
*			They are interactive

*	**Organizing a Presentation**
*		Effective intro
