Here is an example of a thesis statement for a narrative essay that describes the writer's experience of using literacy skills to achieve a goal:

When I set out to save a historical grist mill in my community that was slated for demolition, I learned how valuable my writing skills could be. My letters to the local newspaper got the attention of community leaders and turned the tide of public opinion about the mill's value, and the grant I wrote raised money for a restoration project.

The first paragraph of your paper, the introduction, should grab the reader's attention, provide general background information on the topic you are addressing, and conclude with your thesis statement. Consider the following outline for the introduction:

A. Attention Getter: First, pique your reader's interest by identifying the important literacy moment for your reader.

B. Background and Context: Then, provide details that set the scene for the reader so s/he will understand why the moment was important.

C. Thesis: Finally, end your introduction with your thesis statement. Your thesis will have a claim that explains the importance of your particular literacy moment and 2-4 points of support that explain why it was significant. These 2-4 points of support will be developed in the body of your essay.

The template below is a useful one for a literacy narrative thesis:

______________________ is one of the most important moments in my literacy development because ____________, ________________, and _________________.

Conclusion
In the conclusion, you should include your thesis statement and a 1-2 sentence summary of each of the points discussed in the paper. Do not provide any new information in the conclusion.

Literacy Narrative

The classroom was unremarkable. I remember a seldom-used chalkboard and several scuffed and dinged desks, reminiscent of those used in high school. An adjustable arm attached the desktop to the seat; we moved it aside so that we could cross our legs as we sat in a wide circle. The room was without projector, lectern, or desk for the instructor. She sat among the students with her notes on her lap, legs crossed like us. I think there were fourteen of us, including the instructor, all women. We met three days a week during that fall semester to talk and write about women's literature, about women and literature, about women in literature. For the first eight weeks of class, the windows remained open so that we might catch a breeze on those stifling Georgia afternoons. We sat without complaint, patting beads of perspiration from our foreheads and upper lips, in that unremarkable classroom with no air conditioning. We read passages aloud from our dog-eared paperbacks, scribbled in the margins, and expressed our outrage and admiration. In that very unremarkable classroom, a most remarkable transformation occurred. I became aware of the power of the written word, the labor required to write with insight, and the value of community.

Never before had I realized the intensity of language. Admittedly, our instructor's presence captivated us. Youthful, barely a decade older than the women under her tutelage, she had style and poise. She quickly dispensed with our use of any type of title, preceding her last name. No use of "Dr." or "Ms." She insisted that we call her Iris, and during the first days of class, she fostered the conditions that created an environment of mutual respect. Each class would begin with her reading aloud a passage from whatever novel we were studying. It was always a carefully chosen passage, selected for its beauty, hidden meaning, humor, or vulgarity, and read with thespian inflections and pitch-perfect emphasis. Iris mesmerized us with her ability to take on the voice of the character or moderate her tone to match the perspective of the omniscient narrator. After these daily performances, she would put down the book and say, "So, scholars, what do you make of that?" It soon became clear that she had no plans to interpret works for us. Iris expected us to engage in close reading, critical analysis, and thoughtful writing.

It soon became obvious to me that competent writing required hard work. A three to five- page literary analysis was required for each of the five novels we read. She returned my first paper with no grade but with neatly written notes sprinkled throughout. Her comments encouraged me to develop a thought with more depth, challenged me to use more textual evidence to support my point, or praised my insight into another aspect of the novel. At the end of the paper, Iris wrote, "Your analysis has great potential." Disheartened that my work was so inferior that it did not warrant even a low grade, I timidly asked another classmate what grade she had earned. She reported that she had not received a grade either, just comments and questions throughout. The next day in class Iris explained to us that we could resubmit the same papers and she would assign a grade immediately, or we could use her feedback and the feedback of our classmates to revise our analyses.

Grateful for the opportunity to improve our essays, we began working collaboratively. Within minutes, we were pushing and dragging those desks so that we could face each other in pairs, knees nearly touching. We carefully read the work of our classmates. Following Iris' model, we praised what was strong and made gentle suggestions for improving what was weak. Iris called this writing workshop and explained that most of the authors we had studied belonged to writing communities throughout their careers. She worked alongside us, mentored, and even shared examples of her own writing. We learned the craft of revision. We learned how to give

and receive criticism. We learned how to learn from others. We learned that we were, indeed, writers.
In that class, I became aware of the power of the written word, the labor required to write with insight, and the value community. This course taught me the importance of language.   Hearing the words read aloud, and thinking about their meanings, was an important experience. In addition, my teacher's thoughtful comments on my work showed me how challenging it can be to write well. Last, by working together to workshop our writing, I learned the value of my peer's advice for improving my writing. Sometimes, in the most unremarkable settings, magical transformations will occur.
