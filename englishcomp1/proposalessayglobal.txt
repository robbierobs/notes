Global warming is a topic of great discussion and has been since the early 19th century. In the 1820s, a French mathematician and physisicist named Joseph Fourier proposed that energy that reached the Earth as sunlight must be balanced out by energy returning to space and some must be held within the atmosphere to keep Earth warm. He proposed that Earth's atmosphere acts the way a glass greenhouse would. In the 1890s, research from Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist, suggested that the increase and decrease of CO2 levels would increase of decrease global temperature, respectively.In the 1890s, the concept of global warming was remote and some even welcomed it, Arrehenius writing "By the influence of the icnreasing percentage of carbonic acid [CO2] in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth." ******* However, by 1988 this view changed. The summer of 1988 was the hottest on record at the time, with widespread dought and wildfires within the United States. Scientists sounded the alarm about climate change and the media and public started to pay closer attention. In June of 1988, James Hansen came to congress saying he was "99 percent sure" that global warming was upon us. By 2001, reports had come out that global warming was "very likely" to have highly damaging future impacts. In 2015, the Paris Climate Agreement set out for change. 195 countries pledge to set targets for their own greenhouse gas cuts and to report their progress. With sea levels rising almost 12.5 inches in Texas and 8 inches on average, ocean water temperature rising, and wildfires and droughts becoming more common, action must be taken to prevent the continued rise of global warming. An effective way to address global warming is to reduce our dependence on livestock, energy and fuel conservation, and a reduction or elimination of deforestation.

The United States slaughters billions of animals each year for consumption. In 2017 alone, 9 billion chickens, 32.2 million cattle and calves, 241.7 million turkeys, 2.2 million sheep and lambs, and 121 million hogs were slaughtered. This produced 26.3 billion pounds of beef, 25.6 billion pounds of pork, 5.9 billion pounds of turkey, 80.2 million pounds of veal, 150.2 million pounds of lamb and mutton, and 42.2 billion pounds of chicken. This astronomical amount of livestock has a detrimental effect on our global climate due to methane levels that are output from livestock production. Coal, oil and natural gas production and transportation account for half of methane levels, while livestock production, landfills and waste management account for the other half. Accounting for 15% of greenhouse gasses, methane has a warming potention 21 times that of carbon dioxide. Methane is a result of livestock belching and flatulence, along with the use of transportation of the livestock as well. Reducing the amount of meat that we consume on a daily basis would reduce the amount of livestock produced and slaughtered each year, reducing the amount of methane that is released into the atmosphere. 

In the United States, 81% of energy totals comes from oil, coal and natural gas. The transportation sectors accounts for 28.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions with over 90 percent of fuel use being petroleum based, including gasoline and diesel. Electricity production accounts for 28.4% of 2016 greenhouse gas emissions with coal accounting for 33.2% of U.S. electricity, while natural gas (32.7%), nuclear energy (20%) and renewable energy sources made up the rest (13%). Industry (22%), commerical and residential (11%) and agriculture (9%) make up the rest of the emissions in the United States. Simple measured can be taken to reduce our transportation use. Using car pools and public transportation can greatly reduce fuel use while also opening roads up by keeping more personal vehicles off them and reducing emissions. This would also have an effect on the maintence of our vehicles and would reduce wear and tear on public roads. Hybrid vehicles allow us to reduce the total amount of fuel used and are a great transition between electric and tranditional fuel-burning vehicles. Recently, affordable completely electric vehicles have also came to market. These vehicles give us an opportunity to use more efficient means of transportation with a reduced cost of travel while also giving us an opportunity to reduce the total amount of emissions and pollutants.

Energy efficient electronics have proven to be a great way to be more conservative. These products use less energy but give the same performance. They include appliances such as refridgerators and microwaves to entertainment such as television. Energy conservation can consist of buying more effiencient appliances, vehicles and forms of entertainment but can also be reduced by using simple measures. By being sure to switch appliances off, using more efficient consumables, such as LED light bulbs, and unplugging unused devices, we can greatly reduce our personal energy use. By using more efficient products and being more conservative, a dent can be made on the electrical energy needed. Products and goods can also be reused, recycles or repurposed. Water bottles can be reused multiple times or recycled. Reusable grocery bags can be purchased to reduce the amount of plastic bags used. By reducing the amount of goods we purchase, we can cut back on the amount of products produced in factories and the waste that is generated. Chemical reactions from production of goods and raw materials account for the 22% of emissions generated in the industry figure.

Nature is the biggest combatant to global warming and can provide up to 30 percent of the mitigation needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees celsius on average versus the current 3.7-4.8 degree Celsius temperature increase by 2100 (referencehttps://www.conservation.org/what/Pages/Climate.aspx). In Amazonian forests, 1 percent of the tree species is able to isolate 50 percent of the carbon. Trees, by themselves, are able to mitigate massive amounts of human-created emissions that would otherwise contribute to global warming. However, deforestation continues to lead to almost 11% of emissions caused by humans. Specifically, tropical rainforests are critically important at capturing and storing carbon dioxide but have been the target of deforestation. The EDF (Environmental Defense Fund) has reported that from 2000-2009, 32 million acres of tropical rainforest were cleared. By utilizing policies and agreements that promote sustainable practices, we can reduce deforestation and promote sustainable renewable resources for the future. Policies and laws like the Endangered Species Act, the Wilderness Act, the Lacey Act and the Roadless Rule help protect forests and stop illegal products from entering marketplaces. Governments can step in to help stop companies to destroying critical environments that are needed to help stop global warming. Populations can also use certified sustaiable wood in an effort to help reduce deforestation as well.

The effective solution to global warming is through reduction of our dependence on livestock, conservation of fuel and energy, and a reduction or elimination of deforestation. As sea levels rise and wildfires and droughts become more common, it becomes more imminent that we address global warming. By reducing our livestock dependence, conserving fuel and making efforts to reduce our personal vehicle use, buying more energy efficient products, reducing or eliminating deforestation by legislation and using sustainable renewable sources, the effects that humans have created on our planet can be reduced. As temperatures continue to rise at a rate of 3.7-4.8 degrees Celsius by 2100, it's imperative that decisions be made by all to help reverse the effects humans have created for ourselves and generations to come.
