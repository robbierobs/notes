Global warming has been a naturally occuring phenomenon over the last couple hundred years. Though small, these changes have had drastic effects on our planet. Global warming is an issue that will continue to be brought up and will continute to be a concern in our lives as sea levels rise and dangerous heat waves become mroe common. Severe weather is also on the rise with the number of large wildfires growing, more severe doughts and other exctreme storm events increasing in many areas. What has led to this global temperature and climate change? Human-beings have been a main source of contribution in the last couple hundred years. Deforestation and the increase of methane gasses, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbos (CFCs) are some of the most significant causes of the world's problem, global warming.

Although clearing land can be useful for food or feed production, economics or business, deforestation in tropical rainforests adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than the total amount of emissions from cars and trucks on the world's road. Cars and trucks account for about 14 while deforestation attribute upwards of 15 percent of carbon emissions***. Trees use carbon dioxide but when they are felled they release this carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which interacts with greenhouses gasese in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. The EDF (Environmental Defense Fund) has reported that 32 million acres of tropical rainforest were cleared from 2000 - 2009 and the number is only increasing. Though it would be wise to implement change, deforestation is more profitable than conservation. "Conservation costs money, while profits from timber, charcoal, pasture and cropland drive people to cut down forests."****. Convincing the residents of the Amazon basin to reduce deforestation is difficult because the forests are worth more cut down than standing and being conserved.
